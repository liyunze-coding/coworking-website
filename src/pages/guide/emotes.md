# Emotes

Stream emotes are like custom emojis specific to a channel, acting as a fun and engaging way for viewers to express emotions, inside jokes, and reactions during a livestream, fostering a sense of community and shared experience.

## Channel emotes (Twitch)

When you reach the Twitch Affiliate goal, you can add emotes to your channel for subscribers to use! However, Follower emotes are only available if you have [Instant Upload Privilege](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/emote-guidelines?language=en_US#instantupload)

## Emote extensions

Don’t understand when your chat says in ‘KEKW’? It’s a common third party Twitch emote! You can add extensions to your channel to add more emotes for your viewers to use. Some popular ones include BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and 7TV.

### Browser Extensions
  - [Download BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/)
  - [Download FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/)
  - [Download 7TV](https://7tv.app/)

You won’t run into any issues using all three extensions at once!

However, if you only want to use one Emote extension, [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) is probably the best one to go for! It is stable, has special addons through the extension itself for BTTV and 7TV emotes, and has the best customization for Twitch as a site!
