## Microphone quality

Having awful microphone quality on stream would negatively affect the viewer experience. Here are a few tips on how to improve your microphone quality on OBS using filters!

:::note

1. Open OBS
2. Find Mic/Aux in your Audio Mixer
3. Click on the 3 dots  &#65049;
4. Select "Filters"
5. On the bottom right, you should see a plus `+` button. Click it to add a new filter.
:::

- ### Noise Suppression

  The Noise suppression filter OBS helps you easily suppress background noise! You have 2 methods to choose from:

  - **RNNoise** (recommended)
    
    Enhances your microphone quality effectively, however has higher CPU usage.

  - **Speex**
    
    Lower CPU usage, low quality, however you can adjust the threshold and may be a better option if you do ASMR such as keyboard ASMR.

- ### Compressor

  Is your microphone at maximum volume, yet your viewers can't hear you very well? A compressor filter is used to even out the volume levels of your microphone input. It works by reducing the dynamic range of the audio signal, making quieter sounds louder and louder sounds quieter.

  Here's a straightforward [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ZvX7Ys0ghG4) on how to use the compressor filter.

Be sure to test your audio by recording using your streaming software then listening to it.

## How to Separate your Audio for meetings/classes

### Easy way (have two different outputs)

<Image src={AudioSettings} alt="Audio settings" loading="lazy" />

You'll need to have two different audio outputs (i.e. two headphones/speakers). For Windows users, go to sound settings --> advance sound options --> app volume device preferences (or if you can't find it, search "sound mixer options" in your start) then you should see this:

There, you can have your different outputs for different programmes. For example, one pair of headphones is used for zoom, and the other for everything else. In your streaming software, ensure the output is selected for the correct pair of headphones in your mixer!

### Complicated ways

  - Download Voicemeeter Banana (software to route audio sources) and set all the audio sources/inputs you don't want to include on stream into a Voicemeeter input/output source separate from the main routing. 
  - The outputs will show up separately in your Audio Mixer, which you can adjust/mute
