# General Tips

General tips for your coworking streams!

---

## Should I mute?

Most streamers mute themselves during the work sessions because it makes it easier for the viewers to focus. However it’s also possible to leave the mic on for keyboard asmr and general “office noise” which many people enjoy - ask your community what they prefer!

## Chat commands for coworking streams

Chat commands are very useful since you won't be chatting much during the work timer. Some common chat commands you may see include ones that introduce your stream, provide a brief introduction to the pomodoro method (if you use it), or a muted command that may explain why you may be muted (e.g: !welcome !timer !pomo !muted). You may also like to add a command to tell your viewers what you're working on that day (!today !work !study) - this adds a nice personal touch and you can use it to encourage other's to talk about what they're working on too. 

## Closed Captions

Closed captions open your stream to a wider audience by including viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, and can even benefit viewers in noisy environments who might miss some dialogue.

## Do's

- ### Have control of your ad timings

If you're using OBS, you can add the link above as a dock to your OBS (remember to replace "{{channel}}" with your actual channel name). This way, you can easily run ads and view when your next ad break is without having to go to the Twitch dashboard.

- ### Have a consistent stream schedule

A regular stream schedule lets your viewers know exactly when to expect you to go live. When viewers can anticipate your streams, they are more likely to make time to watch, increasing the chances of them tuning in and engaging with your content.

Regularly scheduled streams also help you attract and retain viewers. When new viewers find your stream, they are more likely to follow if they see a consistent schedule. Additionally, existing followers are more likely to continue watching if they know when to catch your streams.

- ### Social Media Marketing

Having good social media marketing allows you to reach a broader audience beyond your live streams. Utilizing platforms like Instagram and YouTube (even YouTube Shorts!) enables you to promote your content, engage with potential viewers and build a loyal following, increasing visibility and attracting new members to your community.

- ### Use stream layouts that make your stream stand out

On Twitch, people would go through the browse section with a frame of your stream as the thumbnail. If you want to increase the chances of people clicking onto your stream, you should make your stream more attractive.

- ### Interact with Chat

Interacting with your chat is crucial to grow your community because it fosters a sense of engagement and connection with your audience. By acknowledging and responding to viewers, you create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, encouraging viewers to stay, become regulars, and invite others, ultimately leading to organic community growth.

- ### Network with other streamers

Having good networking opens up collaboration opportunities, cross-promotion, and exposure to each other’s audiences. By forming connections within the streaming community, you can tap into a larger pool of viewers, gain credibility, and foster a supportive environment that encourages mutual growth and success.

## Don'ts

- ### Don't get distracted by chat

One concern for many new coworking streamers is that they are worried about ignoring chat. This is the hard part! It's important (and very tempting) to interact with your community but it's also important you are able to get your work done. That's the point after all!. Remember you're there to work so try not to feel guilty about ignoring new people - it's useful to have mods who can do this for you instead. And you can always chat with them in your breaktime! If you're too busy to answer questions, it can be useful to have a command like !muted to let new people know that you are trying to focus and will chat later. 

- ### Don't self promote

Hopping on chat and mention anything about your own stream is considered self-promotion and can be considered rude, especially when no permission was granted.

- ### Don't worry about view count

Just focus on your work.

- ### Avoid using Display Capture

Some coworking streamers may have Display Capture source on their primary pomodoro scene for extra accountability. However, this may leak sensitive information such as Email, full name, credentials etc.

It is recommended to blur it, or make your Display Capture source very small until no text content is readable.
